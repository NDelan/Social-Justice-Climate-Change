# Social-Justice: Climate-Change
An interactive enviromental art project that incorporates data on climate change in its scenes.

# Modules and Concepts Applied
1. Object Oriented Design Methods
2. Recursion
3. Lsystem
4. Python Turtle Module
5. Zelle Graphics

# Running 
To run the program, run the 'transition.py' file directly or from the terminal using:

 The heights of the chimneys correspond to the surface temperature, whereas the size of the smoke bubbles represent the amount of smoke from the chimneys.
 This mimics how changes in the volumes of harmful gases that are released into the atmosphere directly relates with the surface temperature.

The transition from green leaves to brown leaves to no leaves of the plants depicts the adverse effects of climate change on plants.
